		<h2>Number 10: Adopt Me</h2>
		
		<p>Adopt Me is a Roblox MMORPG that has a colorful map where players may meet friends, role-play characters, and decorate their houses. Adopt Me, like The Sims, allows users to fully customize their avatars and develop cosmetics for their homes. In keeping with the life simulation premise, players can work jobs and earn income to upgrade their goods, which range from a new couch to a choice of pets to raise. If you're a Sims enthusiast, Adopt Me is a must play and it's ideal for extending your interior design muscles.</p>
